In this repository, we have a project (not finished) of a simple login at:
- Javascript
- React native

In this project I only did the basic features of login, Login, Register and more

Remembering that although I started implementing contact with the database, this project was just for training purposes and so it was not finished

Unfortunately, I lost the images of the project, except for the logo.
